            New York City (NYC), often simply called New York, is the most populous 
            city in the United States. With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817
          distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York City is also
           the most densely populated major city in the United States.[11] Located at
            the southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the
             New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world
              by urban landmass.[12] With almost 20 million people in its metropolitan
               statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical 
               area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has
                been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world,
                 significantly influencing commerce,[13] entertainment, research, technology,
                  education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports, and is the most 
                  photographed city in the world.[14] Home to the headquarters of the United
                   Nations,[15] New York is an important center for international diplomacy,
                   [16][17] and has sometimes been called the capital of the world.

                Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is
                 composed of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the State of New 
                 York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten 
                 Island—were created when local governments were consolidated into a single
                  city in 1898.[20] The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier
                   gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages 
                   are spoken in New York,[21] making it the most linguistically diverse city in 
                   the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the
                    United States,[22] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world 
                    as of 2016.[23][24] As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to
                     produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York
                      metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest
                       economy in the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of
                        any city in the world.
